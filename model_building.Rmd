## Analysis 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rate_complete_df = read_csv('./data/rate_complete.csv')
```

Since our outcome, HIV Diagnoses rate, is calculated using a count variable (number of HIV Diagnoses) repeated over 2013-2019, weâ€™ll model it using Generalized Estimating Equation with a Poisson link function.

```{r}
rate_complete_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hiv_diag_rate)) + 
  geom_density() +
  theme_light() +
  labs(x = "HIV Diagnoses Rate",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of HIV Diagnoses Rate") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
