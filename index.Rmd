## **Motivation**
According to the latest report from New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene HIV Epidemiology Program, there was 197 new HIV diagnoses and 1683 deaths among people with HIV (8.6 per 1000 people with HIV) in 2018. We would like to investigate the general trend of HIV diagnosis from 2011 to 2019, and also analyze the potential influence factors of it. In this project, we examined the trend of HIV prevalence and incidence from 2011 to 2019. In particular, we are interested in:

* What is the general trend of HIV diagnoses across time?
* What is the demographics of the HIV population? 
* Are HIV diagnses different among different boroughs? 
* Are unemployment rate and crime rate influential contributor to HIV prevalence?


## **Data Resources**

* [***HIV/AIDS Annual Surveillance Statistics***](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/hiv-aids-annual-surveillance-statistics.page) Annual data are provided by NYC Department of Health on new diagnoses of HIV (non-AIDS), concurrent HIV/AIDS and AIDS, as well as the number of persons living with HIV and AIDS and the number of deaths among persons with HIV and AIDS. The data are shown for New York City overall and by sex, race, age, borough, area-based poverty level, risk factor, and United Hospital Fund neighborhood. All the data used in this project was extracted from 9 PDF files of the annual reports.

* [***Unemployment Rate***](https://labor.ny.gov/stats/LSLAUS.shtm) Unemployment information for all boroughs in New York City (1990-2020) from New York State Department of Labor. We used the data from 2011 to 2019 in this project.

* [***Crime Data***](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/historical.page) Citywide crime data are provided by New York City Police Department (NYPD). The data shows annual number of seven major felony offenses (murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny of a vehicle) by precinct (2013-2019).

* [***Census Data***](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Census-Demographics-at-the-Neighborhood-Tabulation/rnsn-acs2) Census data are provided on neighborhood tabulation area level by Department of City Planning (DCP). Since census takes place every 10 years, we used total population in 2010 census to calculate all rate measures.
